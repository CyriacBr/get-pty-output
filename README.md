# `get-pty-output`

> An alternative to `child_process.exec` with PTY support

Node doesn't natively support creating pseudo-terminals. When running an external command
with `child_process.spawn` or `exec`, ansi colors are lost because most of CLIs disable colors when they aren't run inside a TTY environment.
You can make your child inherit the parent `stdio`, thus allowing colors, but this results in the inability to properly capture outputs.

Some packages like `node-pty` aim to solve this problem, but they rely on `node-gyp`, and doesn't support newer Node versions.
This package leverage Rust's `portable-pty`(unix) and `conpty`(windows) crates with [n-api-rs](https://github.com/napi-rs/napi-rs) for bindings, allowing way better
cross-platform support and easier installation.

## Install

```
yarn add get-pty-output
```

## Usage

```ts
import { exec, execSync } from 'get-pty-output'

const res = await exec('node -e console.log(100)')
res.output // in color! âœ¨
```

### Options

```ts
exec(cmd, {
  cwd: 'path-to-desired-wd',
  /**
   * Close the pty after a timeout.
   */
  timeout: 10,
  /**
   * Close the pty after a timeout since the command became idle.
   * A command is considered idle when it has stopped writing on stdout.
   * Only works on UNIX platforms for now.
   */
  idleTimeout: 5,
  /**
   * Remove cursor transformations from the output.
   * Defaults to true. You may disable this if you notice your output is weirdly truncated.
   * If the command you're executing transforms the terminal cursor (spinners, progress bars, etc),
   * you likely want to keep this to true
   */
  purify: true
  /**
   * A callback that is invoked while the process is running, similarly to
   * `child_process.stdout.on('data', cb)`
   *
   * **Note that when using this option, no output will be returned!**
   */
  onData: line => console.log("line: ", line)
})
```
Output is truncated when a timeout happens. `res.truncated; // true`
